# Fred's Snippets

This is my dumping ground for unrelated commands or scripts I wrote at some point and (probably) haven't added to a module yet.

What can you find here?

+ Experiments: Random bits of PowerShell, as experiments on making stuff work. Not directly useful, but might be something to learn from it.
+ Functions: Mostly standalone functions, ready to plug into your scripts.
+ Scripts: Finished scripts for a dedicated purpose, ready to deploy/schedule/whatever.
+ Templates: Specialized templates - usually for scripts.
